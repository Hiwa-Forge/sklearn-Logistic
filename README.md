**No shortcuts, no fluff** – Logistic Regression trained on the classic Digits dataset. Manual accuracy calculation, clean preprocessing, and pure scikit-learn power.

## About
This project is a straightforward yet powerful implementation of Logistic Regression on the handwritten digits dataset (0-9).  
I loaded the data from scikit-learn, split it, trained the model, and calculated accuracy manually – no reliance on ready-made metrics.  
The goal: demonstrate deep understanding of the algorithm's inner workings and full control over the process.

Clean classification, built to last. Future projects will push the boundaries further.
